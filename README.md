## Overview
The JK Weather App is a responsive web application that allows users to check current weather conditions for any city worldwide. The app provides essential weather information including temperature, weather description, wind speed, and displays an appropriate weather icon.

## Features
- **City-based Weather Search**: Users can enter any city name to get current weather data
- **Comprehensive Weather Data**: Displays temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, and date
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows weather condition icons for better user experience
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth animations when displaying weather information
- **Date Display**: Shows current date using Moment.js

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: jQuery, Moment.js, Animate.css, Font Awesome
- **Styling**: Google Fonts (Montserrat)
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap (implied by the functionality)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source files
2. Ensure you have all the required files:
   - `index.html` (the provided HTML file)
   - `style2.css` (companion stylesheet)
   - `script2.js` (companion JavaScript file)
3. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser

Note: The application requires an internet connection to load CDN resources and fetch weather data.

## Usage
1. Open the application in your web browser
2. Enter a city name in the input field
3. Click the "Get Weather" button
4. View the weather information displayed below the input field

## Project Structure
The application consists of three main components:

1. **HTML (index.html)**:
   - Defines the structure of the weather app
   - Includes all necessary CDN links
   - Contains the user interface elements

2. **CSS (style2.css)**:
   - Handles the visual styling of the application
   - Manages layout and responsive design

3. **JavaScript (script2.js)**:
   - Contains the weather fetching logic
   - Handles user interactions
   - Processes and displays weather data

## API Integration
The application integrates with a weather API (implied by the functionality, though not explicitly shown in the provided code). The JavaScript file (`script2.js`) would typically contain:

- API endpoint configuration
- Fetch requests to retrieve weather data
- Error handling for API responses
- Data parsing and display logic

## Styling
The application uses several styling resources:
- **Google Fonts**: Montserrat for clean typography
- **Font Awesome**: For potential icon usage
- **Custom CSS**: In `style2.css` for application-specific styling
- **Color Scheme**: Features a purple accent color (#80006d)

## Animation
The weather information display includes animations from Animate.css:
- **Fade-in Effect**: When weather data appears
- **Smooth Transitions**: For better user experience

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following external resources:
- **jQuery** (v3.6.0): For DOM manipulation and event handling
- **Moment.js**: For date formatting and display
- **Animate.css**: For CSS animations
- **Font Awesome**: For icon set
- **Google Fonts**: For typography

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the application:
1. **5-Day Forecast**: Extend to show multi-day forecasts
2. **Geolocation**: Automatically detect user's location
3. **Temperature Unit Toggle**: Switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit
4. **Local Storage**: Save recent searches
5. **More Detailed Weather Data**: Humidity, pressure, sunrise/sunset times
6. **Error Handling**: Better user feedback for invalid cities
7. **Theming**: Light/dark mode toggle

## License
This project would typically include an open-source license (MIT, GPL, etc.), though one isn't specified in the provided code. Please add an appropriate license file to your project repository.
